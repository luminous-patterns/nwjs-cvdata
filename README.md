# nwjs-cvdata

Small NW.js app prototype for generating port folio data in JSON. Node 5, ECMA 6, NW.js, Angular.js.

I initially built this to make it really easy for me to turn my CV / port folio in to JSON, which is useful to me as I can then put that JSON through other apps/scripts I've written, in order to generate my CV and skill matrix PDFs (and a port folio mini-site).

Then I released it to the world, just because.

## Do what you want, but don't ask me for help

I published this in the hopes someone will find it useful or learn something from it, maybe even base something more awesome on it.  I only spent ~8 hours on it, so please excuse any imperfections and don't be surprised if you find a bug or two lurking.

## Features

- Load/save (and automatic quick saves...every 5 seconds...)
- ECMA 6 classes
- Quickly create your JSON CV
- Minimal code with not much structure (it is a prototype after all)

## Install & play

Download it, unzip it, then (with Node 5.x and NPM already installed) open bash/shell, cd to the project directory, and do an `npm install` - when that's finished start the app with `npm start`.

Pick apart the code, build something awesome, and have fun!
